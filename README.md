## 🧨💥 This isn't just a capstone.  
### It's a f***ing **detonation of perception.**  
> From unstructured prompts,  
> through explosive synthesis,

>
> 💣 This is perception turned into reality. This is **GARASANI**.

## 🎯 Project Goal  

To build an end-to-end system that:

1. 💣 Generates 3D scenes via **3D Gaussian Splatting**
2. 💣 Segments objects with potential for **interaction**
3. 💣 Meshes them into **GLB assets**
4. 💣 Deploys them in **VR** for real-time manipulation

> Not just generation. Interpretation. Extraction. Re-creation.

## 🎇 Manifesto

> *From splat to signal,*  
> *from blur to boundary,*  
> **we bring clarity to virtual chaos.**

> 💣 *We don’t just render.*  
> 💣 *We reveal.*  
> 💣 *We garasani.*
